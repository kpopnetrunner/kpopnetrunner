In this episode, additional rumors spread about Yoshida and Yano. The rumors about Yoshida are about her being a deliquent and physically abusive. The rumors about Yano involve her being promiscuous. One thing in common between the rumors is that they are supposedly spread by Sawako. Yoshida and Yano intially laugh off the idea that Sawako could be the one spreading the rumors. However, they overhear part of a conversation that Sawako has with female classmate Kiryuu Shino that causes them to think that Sawako really did spread the rumors.

Shino indirectly asks Sawako about the rumors about Yoshida and Yano. Sawako misunderstands Shino and thinks that Shino is asking about the rumors involving Sawako and spirits. Sawako tells Shino that it is a misunderstanding. Shino then asks Sawako about her friendship with Yoshida and Yano. At this moment, Yoshida and Yano are walking in the hallway and hear this part of the conversation. Sawako tells Shino that they are not her friends. After that statement from Sawako, Pin calls Yoshida and Yano to help him with an errand. This prevents Yoshida and Yano from hearing Sawako's reasoning for her saying that Yoshida and Yano are not her friends. Sawako explains to Shino that Yoshida and Yano are very close and that she doesn't feel qualified to be a friend on that level, but that she really likes Yoshida and Yano.

Yoshida and Yano ask Sawako if Sawako likes them. Sawako hesitates because she doesn't know how to put into words how she feels towards Yoshida and Yano. Yoshida and Yano interpret this hesitation as proof that Sawako was behind those rumors and that she doesn't care for them. Yoshida and Yano then stop interacting with Sawako and sit in their seats while displaying sullen body language. Sawako notices their body language and wonders about it. Later in the day, Sawako overhears girls gossiping about her by saying that Sawako is using Kazehaya, Yoshida, and Yano to improve her social status by being associated with them.

Sawako then understands why Yoshida and Yano were upset. She apologizes to Yoshida and Yano for causing them to experience negative feelings. Yoshida and Yano are not sure if Sawako is talking about her spreading rumors or if it is about something else. Sawako then runs away from Yoshida and Yano.

Sawako then encounters Kazehaya, but she avoids him because she doesn't want to diminish Kazehaya's social standing. Kazehaya asks Sawako if she is avoiding him and Sawako tells him that nothing could make her want to stay away from him. Sawako then runs away.

Sawako is really going through it this episode. She went from being happy about having friends to now feeling sad because of the rumors. The rumors are causing harm to Sawako's friendships with Yoshida, Yano, and Kazehaya. Sawako wants to clear up the misunderstanding so she runs to find the people who spread the rumors.
