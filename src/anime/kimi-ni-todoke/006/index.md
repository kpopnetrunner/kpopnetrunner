This episode continues from the cliffhanger from last episode where Sawako tells the girls that those rumors about Yoshida and Yano are a misunderstanding. The other girls encircle Sawako. One of the girls, the main bully named Yuka, pushes her against the wall and later pushes her to the ground. Sawako defends Yoshida and Yano from the rumors. In this exchange, Sawako first learns that the rumors say that Sawako spread the rumors. Yoshida and Yano overhear that Sawako is arguing with girls in the bathroom about the rumors. Yoshida and Yano rush into the bathroom to help Sawako.

When Yoshida and Yano arrive at the bathroom, they overhear Sawako defend them from the rumors. Yuka suggests that Sawako used Yoshida and Yano to get close to Kazehaya and then she spread the rumors to get rid of Yoshida and Yano once she got close to Kazehaya. Sawako says that Yuka is blind to the truth. Sawako explains that Yoshida and Yano are kind to her and that Sawako really likes them. Yoshida and Yano, now knowing Sawako's true feelings about them, confront Yuka and the other girls. Yoshida tells Yuka that if she messes with Sawako then she will have problems with her. Intimidated by Yoshida, Yuka and the other girls leave. Sawako asks Yuka to take back what she said. Yuka complies. Sawako is happy that now everyone knows that it was a misunderstanding. Yano says tells Sawako, "that's enough." Yoshida and Yano know the real reason behind the rumors was because Yuka likes Kazehaya. Sawako is innocent and doesn't know the reason behind the rumors.

While Yuka and the other girls are leaving the bathroom, Kazehaya says "Hateful gossip is disgusting." The girls overhear Kazehaya referring to them. This statement by Kazehaya hurts Yuka, because Yuka has a longstanding crush on Kazehaya. Yuka has now ruined her chance of being in a relationship with Kazehaya. All of the other students learn the truth that Sawako did not spread the rumors about Yoshida and Yano.

Sawako, Yoshida, and Yano reconcile. Sawako tells Yoshida and Yano that she wants to be friends with them. Yoshida tells Sawako that they have been friends since the first day they met. At the end of this episode, Sawako, Yoshida, and Yano go together to a restaurant to eat ramen together. I feel happy that everything is okay now between Sawako, Yoshida, and Yano.
