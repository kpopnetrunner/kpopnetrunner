The main homeroom teacher is still out sick, so there is a substitute teacher in class. Arai Kazuichi is the baseball coach of Kitahoro High School. His nickname is Pin. Pin shows his bravery by staring into Sawako's eyes for a few seconds, in a boastful way of showing the class that nothing happened to him. Pin asks for a volunteer so that he can offload his work of creating an attendance log to the student. No one wants to volunteer so Sawako offers to do it. Kazehaya also volunteers so him and Sawako can finish the work together and be done quicker. A few other students also volunteer. Pin, sensing that Kazehaya has a crush on Sawako, demands that he report to the teacher's office. When Kazehaya gets there, Pin's stomach is upset so Pin rushes to the restroom. 

Kazehaya sneaks away from the teacher's office to visit Sawako. He helps with part of the attendance log. Back from the restroom and noticing that Kazehaya is gone, Pin makes an announcement over the school intercom that if he doesn't show up in one minute, he will tell embarassing stories about Kazehaya. Kazehaya then rushes away. On the way out, he asks Hirano Eriko and Endo Tomomi, two female students, to help Sawako with the attendance log. Sawako becomes friends with Eriko and Tomomi. They say that Sawako is always volunteering for the class, and they want to help. A little later, there is a scene with Ume eavesdropping on a conversation between Kazehaya and Sawako. 

The next day, Kazehaya passes a note to Sawako asking her to meet him after school with the puppy. The puppy was named Pedro Martinez by Pin, and Sawako calls the puppy Maru-chan. Kazehaya asks Sawako how she spends her time after school. Sawako tells him that shey studies. She explains that she likes to study by imagining how she would help a classmate learn a concept. 

The next day, Kazehaya asks Sawako for help on the English homework in front of the class. Sawako has a talent for tutoring and soon she is explaining things to many students. Sawako is happy to help and she flashes a rare smile.

At the end of the episode, Yano and Yoshida hear other girls gossiping about them and spreading rumors. When they confront the girls and demand to know who spread the rumors, they say that it was Sawako.
