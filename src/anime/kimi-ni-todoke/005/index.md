In the beginning of this episode, Sawako is really sad about the loss of her friends because of the rumors. She thinks that she can continue on like how it was like before when everyone avoided her, but now that she knows what friendship is like, she doesn't want to return to like how things were in the past. Kazehaya confronts Sawako and asks why she is avoiding him. She tells him the truth about the rumors and how she doesn't want him to lose his reputation by being friends with her. Kazehaya tells Sawako that he doesn't care about the rumors and that it is his decision to make if he wants to be around Sawako. 

Kazehaya encourages Sawako to talk to Yoshida and Yano also. Both Yoshida and Yano think about how Sawako treated them in the past. Yoshida remembers how Sawako went to the effort to create a study guide to help her on the midterm. Yano thinks about how Sawako checked out many books from the library about ghost stories because Sawako wanted to learn how to tell ghost stories at Yano's suggestion. Both Yoshida and Yano really care about Sawako. Ryu reasons with Yoshida that Sawako doesn't have anyone to gossip to about the rumors, so it doesn't seem like she was the one behind the rumors.

Sawako overhears other girls talking about the rumors about Yoshida and Yano in the bathroom. She exits her stall to tell them that it is a misunderstanding. One of the main bullies corners Sawako against the wall and mocks Sawako. This episode ends on a cliffhanger because we don't know what happens next after Sawako is corned by the bullies.
