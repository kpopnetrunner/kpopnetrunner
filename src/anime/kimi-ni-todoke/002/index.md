Sawako encounters a stray puppy on the way to school while it is raining. She decides to leave her umbrella covering the puppy to keep it dry. Her motto is: "One good deed everyday." As a result of this decision, Sawako arrives to class soaking wet. Yoshida gives Sawako a smelly shirt to wear and Kazehaya gives her his towel. Sawako is grateful for these actions by her friends. Sawako explains to Kazehaya that she gave up her umbrella to protect the puppy from the rain. Kazehaya says that he has seen the same puppy.

On the following day at school, the other students in Sawako's classroom have this mistaken belief that everyone who is around Sawako will have something bad happen to them. For instance, in their minds, because the teacher received help from Sawako over the summer break, he got physically sick from an illness as a result of spending time with Sawako. None of the students want to sit next to her as a result. Sawako tries to clear up this misunderstanding with two female students, but they run away. Yano sees this interaction. When it is time for the classroom to draw from a box for a new seating arrangement, the other students hope that they do not sit next to Sawako.

One by one, Kazehaya, Yano, and Yoshida deliberately choose to sit next to Sawako. We are introduced to Sanada Ryu because he draws a seat in the back next to the window (a seat that Yoshida wants for herself). Ryu refuses to give up his seat so as a result, Ryu sits behind Sawako while Kazehaya sits beside her. Yano and Yoshida sit in front of her. Sawako has baked treats to give to her friends as appreciation for them giving her dry clothes and a towel. They each enjoy the treats.

After school, Kazehaya and Sawako go back to the puppy. Kazehaya decides to adopt the puppy. Kazehaya says that Sawako can see the puppy again. Kazehaya gets a little jealous that by assuming that Sawako only wants to see the puppy again and not him. Sawako explains that of course she wants to see both Kazehaya and the puppy again.

At the end of this episode, a group of female students are remarking about how Kazehaya is still hanging around Sawako despite rejecting him. We see a glimpse of a female student named Kurumizawa Ume. From the few episodes of this anime I have seen, I know that Ume is important to the story.

I really like the selflessness Sawako displayed by helping the puppy. It shows a lot about her character. I feel happy about Sawako making new friends. They each care for her in their own ways.
