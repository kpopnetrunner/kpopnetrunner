Chapter 1 of the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes covers how to install Python and Sublime Text. At the end of this chapter, there are instructions on how to create a Hello World program in Python.

hello_world.py
{% raw %}
```python
print("Hello Python world!")
```
{% endraw %}

One useful tip that I learned from this chapter is how to open a terminal window in Linux using a keyboard shortcut. If I press together CTRL + ALT + T, this will open a terminal window.
