title: Why I Built a Website
date: 2026-01-08

I wanted to build a website because I wanted to learn. Growing up, I was facinated by computers. I eventually built my own gaming computer and then upgraded that computer with a used Founder's Edition RTX 3090. 

I also like the idea of having complete control over this website. I can write and post about anything within reason (and within the law). I want to have a personal blog that documents my learning progress. I also want to train myself to commit to long-term projects. This website is the platform to do just that. I have a beginner's understanding of the Python programming language and Linux. I want to expand my knowledge within these two topics and operating this website will help me do that. I have the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. I intend to work through that book chapter by chapter while posting my progress on Github. My goal is to be ready to work with object-oriented programming to build custom software that solves my own personal problems. I can then branch out to learn machine learning and how to build AI systems with that knowledge.

I want this website to be an anonymous and personal website to blog about my interests. I want to become a better writer also, and the only why I can improve is by writing. I have an easier time writing about my interest (anime, K-pop, programming) so an anonymous website is perfect for me.

I also like the video game Cyberpunk 2077. There are characters in that game who are expert hackers called netrunners. I decided on the name of my website by combining my interest in K-pop and my aspiration to become a skilled computer programmer. That's how I came up with the name kpopnetrunner.
