This episode shows the members of Itzy practicing in the practice room before their official debut in three days. Their official showcase will take place the following day. The episode shows the members of Itzy practicing the dance cover of Like OOH-AHH by TWICE and also their official debut song, Dalla Dalla. At the end of the episode, it shows Chaeryeong along with Lia & Yuna in their respective dorm rooms. I can feel their nervousness/excitement.
