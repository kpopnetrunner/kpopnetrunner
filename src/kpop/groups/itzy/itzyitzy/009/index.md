This episode shows the members of Itzy during their debut music program. The opening shot is Ryujin holding the camera with the other members of Itzy in a van traveling to their destination. Chaeryeong says, "Is this on? Yes." The group in unison says, "Hello." Chaeryeong says, "We just finished shooting for M Countdown and now we're on our way to Music Bank."

Yeji says, "We all wore white padded jackets for our first appearance on Music Bank." Lia says, "It's our first time!" Ryujin says, "Finally." Yeji says, "So excited. We'll do even better today." The members then each say, "hwaiting," and wave to the camera.

Yeji, Yuna, Chaeryeong, Ryujin, and Lia separately pose for polaroid pictures. Yuna retakes her picture.

The members of Itzy then participate in the rehearsal and then a live pre-shoot with fans.

The members of Itzy are then shown in the waiting room. Yuna enthusiastically says, "We're going to eat the famous Inkigayo sandwiches." A staff member tells them that the shop that sells the sandwiches is closed. The members of Itzy are disappointed. Lia says, "That's okay. We'll come again next week and the week after."

After the pre-shoot, Yeji says, "Let's name a stronger effort for our next performance!" Lia says, "I had some many things I wanted to say after being with ITZY for a week but I couldn't say everthing in my mind." Lia then gets tears and her eyes and the other Itzy members comfort her.
