The members of Itzy dance the choreography to their song Dalla Dalla. Yeji tells the fans, "Thank you so, so much for coming to see us. Please give lots of love to ITZY!" Later, speaking directly to the camera, Lia says, "Thank you for coming to root for us. We'll try even harder from now on. Thanks." Ryujin says, "It was so... amazing to see all the fans." Lia then says, "I wanted to say 'hi'... multiple times during the performance." Ryujin says, "I wanted to see the fans instead of the cameras." Yeji says, "I will remember this day forever. ITZY's with the fans. A lot of you. So many fans, we love you." Yuna says, "I was nervous to perform for the first music program. I didn't expect so many fans to show up. Thank you!"
