This episode consists of Yeji's vlog for the Show Champion shoot. In the beginning of this episode, Yeji says, "I'm debating what to have for lunch." Yeji then eats a piece of a snack, and says, "I can't live without snacks."

Yeji is wearing a blue outfit. Yeji points the camera at a mirror to show the outfit and says, "A lot of fans told me I look good in blue. Thanks. Do I look okay?" After a jump cut, Yeji says to the camera, "I'll do my best today! On both the live broadcast and the pre-recording! Buh-bye."

Yeji is later shown in her dorm room. Yeji says, "Now I'm back home. I live with Ryujin in this room. Lia gave these pajamas to everyone when we first came here. They're all custom-picked. Pretty, huh? So pretty."

Yeji gives an introduction of herself by saying, "Let me introduce myself, Hwang Yeji... Where should I begin? Born in 2000, a millennium baby. People born in 2000 are finally turning 20. So I left a video message to myself just a minute before New Year's Day and another one a minute after to 20-year-old Yeji. It was a fun message." Yeji then shows the video message on her phone. Yeji painted her fingernails black. In the video, the younger Yeji says, "December 31st. Yeji, you did well in 2018. Keep it up in 2019." Raising her right arm straight up, Yeji says, " Let's fly!" Yeji then waves at the camera and says, "Bye, my teen years." Yeji continues and says, "I did this, and then a minute after--I'm searching for the video I made on January 1st. I want you to see it. I should find it. Agh... It's gone."

Yeji continues the introduction by stating facts about herself. She says, "I like snacking. Snacks and chocolate. If I'm on a variety show later and play a 'Guess the Snack' game, I can get every snack right just by tasting or smelling it. My favorite color is black. I prefer casual fashion usually. A natural look. And then there's Hongsam (Korean for 'red ginseng') He just turned 2. Let me show you my puppy." Yeji shows a picture of her puppy on her phone and says, "Pretty, right?"

Yeji decides to leave a video message to her puppy. She says, "Let me leave him a video message. Dear Hongsam, I've finally debuted. I will watch your videos every day so watch me on TV too."

Yeji then looks at baby pictures of herself. Yeji shows a picture of her when she was two years old. Yeji then recommend the book called "A Week with the Little Prince." Yeji explains that that book has helped her to come to love books.

Talking about the support Itzy has received, Yeji says, "The fact that we're already getting so much love is like a dream. I hope you keep a close eye on us and continue to love us. I think we're like a revolving door. You can't really pick a favorite. I'm not lying. The reason we have such great teamwork is because everyone's really nice." Yeji then leaves a video message for the other Itzy members by saying, "Hi, ITZY members. It feels weird to talk to you like this but I just wanted to tell you I sometimes forget or miss things. But you always understand and follow my lead. And help me with everything. So thanks so much for that. Let's do our best, become closer, and care for each other as a team. Thanks so much for understanding and trusting me and treating me like a big sister, like family. I'm looking forward to our brighter future. I love you."

Yeji ends the vlog by saying, "I am so very grateful that the ITZY members are Yuna, Chaeryeong, Ryujin, and Lia. I'll take a shower now and get ready for M Countdown tomorrow. And the fans! Thank you for loving ITZY." Yeji waves her hand at the camera and says, "Bye, bye!"
